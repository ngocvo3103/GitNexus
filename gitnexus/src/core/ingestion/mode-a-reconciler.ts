/**
 * Mode A — LSP reconciliation (WI-4a session + WI-4b engine).
 *
 * The session funnel is the *single refuse path* for Mode A, the
 * write half of the #159 cycle. It is structurally identical to
 * `withReferenceProvider` (P2, foundation) but the work fn
 * receives a **reconciler session** instead of a read-only
 * `ReferenceProvider` — the session's job is to:
 *
 *   1. Discover the TypeScript language server (KD-1).
 *   2. Start a warm `LspClient` and run the readiness probe
 *      (I-6, sole gate).
 *   3. Merge the correction + recall feeds, stable-sort by
 *      `(sourceId, calledName, line, character)`, and take the
 *      first N (cap 2000) — KD-9.
 *   4. For each candidate: issue ONE
 *      `textDocument/definition` request (5000ms timeout,
 *      KD-10) at the **callee identifier** position. Normalize
 *      `Location | Location[]` (bare `Location` → array) and
 *      hand each normalized payload to the engine (this file,
 *      WI-4b).
 *   5. Stop the client in `finally` — I-5 (no leaks on any
 *      exit path).
 *
 * **Why the session lives outside `lsp/`:** I-7. The
 * `no-write-invariant.test.ts` forbids any file in
 * `core/ingestion/lsp/` from importing a graph-write API. The
 * reconciler mutates the in-memory graph (`addRelationship`,
 * `removeRelationship`) — that mutation cannot live in `lsp/`.
 * This module lives at `core/ingestion/mode-a-reconciler.ts`,
 * OUTSIDE `lsp/`, and reads from `lsp/` (foundation is
 * read-only).
 *
 * **Why a deps bag (not a class):** the test surface needs to
 * inject fakes for every external surface
 * (`discoverServers`, `LspClient`, `probe`). A bag of functions
 * with real-wiring defaults is the same pattern as
 * `withReferenceProvider`'s `WithReferenceProviderDeps`. The
 * production path uses zero overrides; the test path swaps in
 * `vi.fn()`s.
 *
 * **WI-4b (decision engine) — same file:** the pure decision
 * table (gate, atomic correction, collapse, dry-run) lives here
 * too. The engine exposes `decideForCandidate` (pure, no graph
 * writes) and `applyDecisions` (graph mutator) and
 * `reconcileDecisions` (top-level, wires the in-memory adapter
 * into the existing `mapLocationToNodeId`). The session wires
 * `reconcileDecisions` via the `handToEngine` seam. The engine
 * reads `CALLABLE_SYMBOL_TYPES` from `call-processor.ts` (KD-3)
 * and the in-memory `executeParameterized` adapter from
 * `in-memory-node-query.ts` (KD-2).
